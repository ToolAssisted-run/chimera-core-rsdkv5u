"""Names are never translated or bent (Chimera's owner, 2026-10-31): a
program's, game's, character's, machine's or company's name is written as
it is, in every language. A language whose grammar puts endings on names
says the sentence with a common noun beside the name instead ("ve hre
Sonic CD", "Retro Engine -moottorin"). This checks this core's 26 language
tables (waterbox/languages):

- every name an English text holds is in that text in every language,
  written as it is (a name in another script, such as a transliteration,
  is not there);
- no Latin letter is glued to either side of a name, and no short ending
  is joined to one by a hyphen, colon or apostrophe ("Sonic CD:ssa",
  "Sonic CD-ben", "Origins'"). A particle in another script (Korean's,
  Japanese's) is that language's grammar and leaves the name whole; a
  hyphen and a common noun ("Plus-Inhalte") is a compound, not an ending.

Chimera's tools/check-proper-nouns.py does the same for Chimera's own
tables and names; this one knows this core's names too.

  check-names.py [<languages folder>]

Prints each problem as language key: what, and exits 1 when there is any."""
